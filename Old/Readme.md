# Old

Welcome to the old directory, this is where the graveyard of deprecated files and legacy code resides.

most projects or Files in this directory didn't make the cut or just straight up sucked. They are kept here for historical reference, nostalgia, or just to remind us of past mistakes.

the goal of this directory is to provide a "reference" on what was tried, how it failed and as an idea to keep the old code for reference or inspiration for future projects.
